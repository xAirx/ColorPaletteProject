## Styled Bootstrap

        Custom components with styled-components and integrated with reactstrap


        "Ideally you don't really need styled-components when using a framework like reactstrap. Most of your views and components should just be composing reactstrap components to create layouts, pages and other custom components in order to stay within the reactstrap paradigm."

        https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/7s6fgz/reactstrap_styled_components/


        Reactstrap uses bootstrap's CSS just as bootstrap does only recreating the javascript functionality so that it is not jquery making DOM manipulations. styles-bootstrap basically recreates bootstrap entirely, yes that's right, it defines all of the styles and doesn't actually use bootstrap's css or styles.

        There are advantages to disadvantages to both. 

        With reactstrap, you have to use bootstrap's css which may mean pulling in unused styles, but you can create a custom build of bootstrap css (per their docs) to only include the component styles you need.
