# ColorPaletteProject

   ## App made in React 

    __________________________________
    
     A React App, consisting of playing with various libraries such as chroma.js.
     
     There is a heavy emphasis on using Material UI, along with flexbox, and CSS.
     
     The idea was to explore component interaction, prop passing, state, looping // mapping and conditional rendering,
     
     While having a focus on design and responsiveness as well.
     
     
     
     
## Imagery - low quality (Giphy was not nice to the gifs, the app looks great.)
